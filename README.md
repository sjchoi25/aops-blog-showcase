# aops-blog-showcase
A page for people to showcase their AoPS blogs. This website is meant to be an alternative to display blogs on the Art of Problem Solving website.

## Credits
All credit goes to Art of Problem Solving for 99% of the code here. I only edited the code slightly to fit into a static site format. The only file that I have created is `assets/js/script.js` used to toggle hides, tips, and to toggle comments. Credits must also go to @BypassSpace's AoPS Blog CSS Editor that inspired the idea.
This code is not created by or affiliated in any way with Art of Problem Solving Inc.

## NOTE:
This display blog does not accurately replicate the AoPS blog experience; most notably when using code that modifies the entries so that they only show when you click them (i.e., vscode.css), there are a few visual discrepancies.
