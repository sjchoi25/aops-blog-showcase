# aops-blog-showcase
A page for people to showcase their AoPS blogs. This website is meant to remove display blogs on the Art of Problem Solving website.

## Credits
All credit goes to Art of Problem Solving for 99% of the code here. I only edited the code slightly to fit into GitHub. Most of the code was slightly updated to remove errors and many files have been removed. The only file that I have made is `assets/js/script.js` used to toggle hides, tips, and to toggle comments.
This code is not created by or affiliated with Art of Problem Solving Inc.
